# Prisma

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an open-source toolkit for database workflows, consisting of three major components: Prisma Client, Prisma Migrate and Prisma Studioâ€”the first of which is production ready, with the latter two flagged as experimental at time of writing.

Prisma Client is a query builder. It is used in Saruni applications to send database queries that read and write data from our database.

Prisma Migrate is a tool for migrating database schemas. It is used in Saruni applications when we need to create, update or remove tables in our database.

Prisma Studio is a graphical user interface that allows us to view and edit data in a database. This is not yet used in Saruni workflows and we recommend [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) as a drop-in replacement for the time being.

## Prisma schema

Central to usage of Prisma in Saruni applications is the `api/prisma/schema.prisma` file. This is a declarative representation of database schemas that would traditionally be written imperatively with SQL.

Rather than telling our database to execute a certain operation like creating a table, the Prisma schema _describes_ the structure of the database schema. This description can generate a Prisma Client, which can then be used to send database queries.

In the following example, we describe the structure of a `User` table.

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int       @default(autoincrement()) @id
  username  String    @unique
}
```

## Prisma workflow

1. Update `prisma.schema`
2. Run `yarn saruni db migrate save`
3. Run `yarn saruni db migrate up`
4. Run `yarn saruni db generate`
5. Use Prisma Client in our application

We start by updating a model in our `prisma.schema` to reflect a desired change. For example, we might add a `createdAt` field to our `User` model.

```prisma.schema
model User {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  username  String   @unique
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Running the `db migrate save` command adds a new timestamped directory in `api/prisma/migrations` detailing the changes made to the schema and a snapshot after the migration is applied.

The `db migrate up` command takes take of applying the migration, so the changes made to our schema are reflected in the database.

When the `saruni db generate` command is run we can expect an update to the Prisma Client that is written directly to the `node_modules` directory for use in our application.

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const db = new PrismaClient();

const createUser = async (_parent, args) => {
  await db.user.create({ data: { ...args.input } });
};
```
