# Services

In the event that [services offered by Saruni](http://localhost:8000/docs/api-reference/services) do not fit the needs of our web application, we can create our own services and deploy them as functions to AWS Lambda.

The syntax for creating any service is always the same and we store services in the `api/src/services` directory.

```ts
export const handler = async (event, context) => {
  console.log("EVENT: \n" + JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
  return context.logStreamName;
};
```

## Deployment

To deploy custom services to AWS Lambda, we write a `serverless.yml` file for each service.

```yml
service: service-name

provider:
  name: aws
  region: eu-west-1
  stage: dev
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  apiGateway: ...

custom:
  stage: ${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}
  webpack: ...

functions:
  functionName:
    handler: fileName.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: /filePath
          method: put
          cors: true
```
