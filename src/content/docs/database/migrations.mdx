# Migrations

## Introduction

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing for replicable modifications to the database schema.

Through use of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) under the hood, Saruni allows you to write migrations declaratively by updating the `schema.prisma` file.

```packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

## Generating migrations

To create a migration, use the `db migrate save` command.

```bash
yarn saruni db migrate save
```

You will be asked to supply a name for the migration and then youâ€™re done! Each time you run the `save` command, a directory will be created in `prisma/migrations` with a dedicated `README.md` detailing the changes made.

## Running migrations

To run outstanding migrations, use the `db migrate up` command.

```bash
yarn saruni db migrate up
```

This command executes migrations against your database.
