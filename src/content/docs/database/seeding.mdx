# Seeding

There is certain data that needs to be fed to our database before it can be used. That is just a little script that creates entities in our database. In saruni you can find that file in `packages/api/db/seed.ts`.

```ts
import { db } from ".";

export const seed = async () => {
  try {
    /**
     *  Seeding logic.
     */
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(e));
  } finally {
    await db.disconnect();
  }
};
```

Most of the time we want to put constants in their. Like if we have predefined tags.

```ts
import { db } from ".";

export const seed = async () => {
  try {
    await db.tag.create({ data: { name: 'react' } })
    await db.tag.create({ data: { name: 'aws' } })
    await db.tag.create({ data: { name: 'prisma' } })
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(e));
  } finally {
    await db.disconnect();
  }
};
```

This will create the three entities in their (assuming you already done the required migrations). With the help of our `CLI` you can run `yarn sr db seed` to run this script.

A few things worth mentioning.

When you do production, we did not automate this thing. Please use the seed command after you applied your migrations with the bastion host. Later we might automate this process.

The content of this script should result in the same database structure no matter how many times you run it. This way the above script is completely wrong. If I run it 10 times, it will create 10 times 3 tags.

```ts
import { db } from ".";

const difference = <T>(arr1: T[], arr2: T[]): T[] => {
  return arr1
    .filter((item) => !arr2.includes(item))
    .concat(arr2.filter((item) => !arr1.includes(item)));
};

const handleTags = async () => {
  // we want these tags to be in the db all the time
  const tags = [
    "react",
    "aws",
    "prisma"
  ];

  // tags currently in the db
  const tagsFromDb = await db.tag.findMany();

  // what is missing from the db
  const missingFunctions = difference(
    tags,
    tagsFromDb.map((x) => x.name)
  );

  // create the missing tags in the db
  const promises = missingTags.map(async (element) => {
    return await db.tag.create({
      data: {
        name: element,
      },
    });
  });

  // wait for everything
  await Promise.all(promises);
};

export const seed = async () => {
  try {
    await handleTags();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(e));
  } finally {
    await db.disconnect();
  }
};
```

This snippet however can be run 1 time or 3453 times. It will always leave the db in the exact same state.
