# Installation

You can create a new Saruni project with [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (classic).

You could also use [`npx`](https://github.com/npm/npx) but we recommend `yarn` since most commands used during development with Saruni will depend upon it.

```bash
yarn create saruni-app ./my-app
```

```bash
npx create-saruni-app ./my-app
```

## Configuration

Saruni uses the tried-and-tested PostgreSQL as a data store. Follow the [instructions for installation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and then create a local database instance to get started.

```bash
psql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

Saruni interacts with your database instance through [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/introduction) behind the scenes. For that to happen, update the `DATABASE_URL` variable following the PostgreSQL connection URL syntax.

```packages/api/prisma/.env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

Youâ€™ll want to ensure the `username` supplied has suitable read/write permissions.

```bash
psql
\du # list database roles
```

## Run development servers

To work on your Saruni project simply run the `saruni dev` command.

```bash
yarn saruni dev
```

This command launches development servers that boot up local instances of our cloud functions, Prisma client and Next.js project.
