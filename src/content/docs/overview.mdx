# Overview

Saruni is a web application framework that provides the foundational tooling startups need to write and release apps. Our goal is that small development teams feel comfortable writing and deploying world-class applications without breaking a sweat. Saruni offers sensible defaults for common challenges but gives developers full control.

## Motivation

We wrote Saruni after building web and native applications for a large online community.

There were elements of that project that we loved, like GraphQL for modular data fetching; the ACID guarantees and ease of querying a traditional relational database, and the portability of React. But we noticed limitations, too: our backend logic was written in PHP which added technical overhead, and our server-based infrastructure added complexity when scaling.

Saruni adopts the parts we liked and leans on more recent developments in the world of JavaScript and cloud computing to replace the others. We hope youâ€™ll find that Saruni has all you need to build fantastic applications more easily, and that the resources we have put together here can lend a helping hand if and when you need them.
