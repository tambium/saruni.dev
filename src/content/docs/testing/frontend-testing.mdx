# Frontend

Testing the UI is really hard. It is no easy task. A lot of things are going on and can be overwhelming. That is why we had [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) advice in mind when we started thinking about testing.

We advise to create test per pages. Pages are routes in Next.js. They are a compact logical unit. Then we can try to interact with our code as who would enjoy our products. By clicking, typing filling forms, navigating, waiting for data.
