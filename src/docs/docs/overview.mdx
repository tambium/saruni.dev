# Overview

Saruni is a web application framework that uses a modern stack to improve developer experience. Our goal is for small development teams to feel comfortable writing and deploying world-class applications without breaking a sweat. Saruni offers sensible defaults for common challenges but makes every effort to give developers control.

## Motivation

We wrote Saruni after building web and native applications for a large online community.

There were elements of that project that we loved like GraphQL for modular data fetching; the ACID guarantees and ease of querying a traditional relational database, and the portability of React. But we noticed limitations, too: our backend logic was written in PHP which added technical overhead, and our server-based infrastructure added complexity when scaling.

Saruni adopts the parts we liked and leans on the latest developments in the world of JavaScript and cloud computing to replace the others. We hope youâ€™ll find that Saruni has all you need to build fantastic applications more easily, and that you can trust in our community to lend a helping hand if and when you need it.
